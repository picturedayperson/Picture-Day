Picture-Day
===========

A Java program that makes a photo story website sort of.  You give it a directory full of images and it makes a captioned HTML page set out of them.  It has only been tested on Windows.

To run, get the JAR from the latest release here and then do java -jar "Picture Day.jar".  You can also run it by double-clicking it but then you won't see the helpful console output.

I just threw this together and there's a fair chance it won't work and a pretty good chance it won't do what you really want.
